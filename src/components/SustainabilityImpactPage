            - <strong>SDG 2: Zero Hunger</strong>: By improving shrimp survival rates to 94% and predicting yields (e.g., 165 kg), our dashboard ensures a steady supply of shrimp, a vital protein source, supporting food security in regions reliant on aquaculture, such as Southeast Asia.<br />
            - <strong>SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure</strong>: The integration of IoT sensors, a PostgreSQL backend, and a React frontend introduces cutting-edge technology to shrimp farming, enabling real-time monitoring and fostering innovation in agriculture.<br />
            - <strong>SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production</strong>: Our system optimizes feed and water use (e.g., adjusting aerators when oxygen drops to 4 mg/L), reducing waste by an estimated 15% and promoting sustainable production practices.<br />
            - <strong>SDG 14: Life Below Water</strong>: Real-time water quality monitoring prevents marine pollution by minimizing organic waste and chemical runoff, protecting coastal ecosystems like mangroves and reducing the environmental footprint of commercial shrimp farming.

            Shrimp farming faces significant challenges, including high mortality rates (up to 40% in some regions), inefficient resource use, and environmental degradation. Traditional methods lack real-time data, leading to delayed responses to issues like low oxygen levels or poor water quality, which cause substantial losses. Additionally, unsustainable practices contribute to marine pollution and habitat destruction, such as mangrove deforestation. Our dashboard addresses these issues by providing real-time alerts, predictive analytics, and data-driven insights, ensuring healthier shrimp, reduced waste, and environmentally responsible farming practices.

            Shrimp farming accounts for 55% of global shrimp production, with an annual output of over 5 million tons, valued at $40 billion. However, it often leads to severe environmental issues, including the destruction of 38% of the world’s mangroves over the past few decades, water pollution from organic waste (e.g., 1 ton of shrimp produces 0.5 tons of waste), and overuse of chemicals like antibiotics, which harm marine biodiversity. Small-scale farmers, particularly in Southeast Asia and Latin America, face high mortality rates (30-40%) due to inadequate monitoring, resulting in annual losses of up to $1 billion globally. These unsustainable practices threaten both the environment and the livelihoods of millions of farmers.

            We envision a future where shrimp farming is fully sustainable, balancing commercial productivity with environmental stewardship. Our goal is to expand the Shrimp Farming Dashboard to 1,000 farms by 2030, reducing global aquaculture waste by 25%, restoring 10,000 hectares of mangroves through partnerships, and supporting 500,000 small-scale farmers with increased incomes and sustainable practices. By scaling our technology, we aim to set a new standard for aquaculture, ensuring healthy marine ecosystems, resilient food systems, and thriving farming communities worldwide.
